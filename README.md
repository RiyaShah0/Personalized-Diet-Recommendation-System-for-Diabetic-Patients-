# Personalized Diet Recommendation System for Diabetic Patients

## Overview
This project is a **Personalized Diet Recommendation System** tailored for **diabetic patients**, built using **machine learning (ML)**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **large language models (LLMs)**. The system predicts diabetes-friendly ingredients and provides real-time dietary recommendations through an AI chatbot.

## Features
- **ML-Based Predictions**  
  Applied Random Forest, XGBoost, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to predict suitable ingredients and dietary plans with **97% accuracy**.

- **AI Chatbot (RAG Architecture)**  
  Developed a chatbot using the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** framework. Integrated:
  - Hugging Face’s pre-trained LLMs  
  - FAISS for vector search  
  - SentenceTransformers for embedding generation  

- **Expert-Validated Responses**  
  Responses were evaluated by licensed medical professionals — **57.1%** rated the system's recommendations **4 out of 5**, confirming the medical soundness of the advice.

## Tech Stack
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **LLMs & NLP**: Hugging Face Transformers, FAISS, SentenceTransformers  
- **Frontend**: Streamlit  
- **Backend**: Python
